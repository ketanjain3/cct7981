**Persona:** Act as a Senior Software Architect specializing in agentic AI systems and proficient in UML modeling.

**Context:** I am researching and documenting the architecture of an existing agentic workflow system. I need a comprehensive analysis to understand its inner workings for potential improvements and maintenance. [Specify the name/purpose of the agentic system being analyzed here].

**Task:** Create a detailed architectural analysis of the current agentic flow, focusing on the interactions between its components.

**Input Data Specifics:** Assume the agentic flow involves [Specify the key components of the agentic flow - e.g., a planning module, an execution module, a memory module, external tools/APIs].  Focus on the flow of information and control *within* these components. [Add details about the specific technologies used if relevant - e.g., LangChain, AutoGPT, custom code].

**Format/Output Constraints:**
*   **UML Diagrams:** Include the following UML diagrams:
    *   Sequence Diagrams: Illustrating the typical sequence of interactions for a common task. (At least 2 different task scenarios)
    *   Activity Diagrams: Depicting the workflow and decision points within the agentic flow.
    *   Communication Diagrams: Showing the message exchange between components.
*   **Supporting Text:** Accompany each diagram with a concise textual explanation of what it illustrates.
*   **Structure:** Organize the analysis into sections, one for each diagram type.
*   **Tool:** Diagrams can be created using any standard UML modeling tool (e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io, PlantUML).  [Specify preferred diagramming tool if any].
*   **Length:** Aim for a detailed but concise analysis, approximately 1500-2000 words total (including diagram explanations).

**Goal:** To provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the agentic flow's architecture, facilitating further development and maintenance.

[Consider adding 1-2 examples of a typical task the agent performs if needed to clarify the desired scope of the diagrams.]
