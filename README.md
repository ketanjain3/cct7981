**Persona:** Act as a seasoned Software Architect specializing in integrating evaluation frameworks into existing systems.

**Context:** We have an existing software system [Specify the type of system - e.g., a web application, a data pipeline, a machine learning model] and are exploring the integration of Google’s ADK Eval Agent (as documented at https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/) to automate testing and evaluation.

**Task:** Develop a detailed integration plan outlining the steps required to integrate the ADK Eval Agent with our existing system.

**Input Data Specifics:** The primary source of information for this plan is the documentation found at https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/.  [Specify any existing system documentation or architecture diagrams available].  Focus on practical implementation details, not just theoretical concepts.

**Format/Output Constraints:** Present the plan as a numbered, step-by-step guide. Each step should include: (1) a clear description of the action, (2) estimated effort (in hours/days), (3) potential challenges, and (4) required resources.  Include a section outlining the necessary infrastructure changes. Keep the plan concise and actionable – aim for approximately 500-700 words. Output as a markdown list.

**Goal:** To create a clear, actionable plan for successfully integrating the ADK Eval Agent into our system to improve automated testing and evaluation capabilities.

[Consider adding 1-2 examples of existing system components or testing procedures if needed to clarify the integration context.]
